# BlogReader
Blog reader exercise using Google open source blogs - using JSON API and CoreData

The aim is to make a blog reader that can read the blogs offline once downloaded. 

Using Master-detail app template with CoreData enabled. Additionally this is first time I'll start using github for the larger exercises in my iOS dev course in order to get used to version control.
